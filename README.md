# Engel Gatus Portfolio – React

Welcome to the source for [engelgatus.com](https://www.engelgatus.com), a retro‑inspired, animation‑rich professional portfolio crafted with React and deployed via GitHub Pages on a custom domain.  

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a showcase of my work in automation, API integrations, and creative coding—designed to highlight advanced UI/UX, custom animation architecture, and playful retro‑gaming aesthetics.  

Key features:  
- Dynamic 8‑bit avatar and glitch effects  
- Typed intro sequence and sparkle backgrounds  
- Interactive project windows with draggable / resizable UI  
- Lazy‑loaded assets for fast perceived performance  
- Production‑grade motion design powered by Framer Motion  
- Custom sound effects for tactile feedback  

Mobile‑optimized layout and touch interactions are actively being refined.  

## ✨ Live Demo

The portfolio is live at **[engelgatus.com](https://www.engelgatus.com)**, served from GitHub Pages with HTTPS enforced on the custom domain.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React 19** (Create React App)  
- **Framer Motion** for high‑fidelity animations  
- **Howler.js** for sound effects and audio control  
- **React‑Typed** for the typed text intro  
- **Sharp** for image preprocessing and optimization  
- **IntersectionObserver API** for lazy‑loading and scroll‑based triggers  
- **CSS Modules** for scoped, maintainable styling

## 🔊 Accessibility & UX Notes
